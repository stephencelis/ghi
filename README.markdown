## FAQ

- __Where does ghi look for issues?__

By default, ghi looks for GitHub issues by resolving the current working
directory's repository: first it looks for an `upstream` remote, then it
looks at `origin`.

You can override the repository ghi uses by setting the local `ghi.repo`
git configuration variable:

``` sh
$ git config ghi.repo username/reponame
$ ghi list
# username/reponame open issues
...
```

- __How do I specify a GitHub enterprise host?__

Just run the following inside your terminal and you'll be good to go:
``` sh
git config github.host address_of_your_enterprise_host
```

- __How do I enable the pretty colored output?__

Make sure your terminal is configured to display 256 colors. You can
check this by running `tput colors`, which should return `256`.

In case it doesn't you need to set the environmental variable `TERM`:
``` sh
export TERM=xterm-256color # or screen-256color
```
Ideally you'll want to add this to one of your shell configuration files (e.g. `~/.bashrc`).
``` sh
echo "export TERM=xterm-256color" >> ~/.bashrc
```

If for whatever reason you cannot set the `TERM` variable globally, it
is recommended to set an alias:
``` sh
alias ghi='TERM=xterm-256color ghi'
```
This runs `ghi` with full color support, but leaves the rest of your
terminal untouched.

Ubuntu users of a version prior to 12.04, beware! Your terminal will not
support 256 colors by default. You need to get an additional library
before before setting the `TERM` variable.
``` sh
sudo apt-get install ncurses-term
```

Don't forget to reload your config file (e.g. `source ~/.bashrc`) or
just reopen your terminal.

- __What about cygwin‽__

`less` can be problematic... you can use `less -R`.
```sh
git config --global ghi.pager "less -X -F -R"
```

- __Can I have syntax highlighting of [fenced code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown#syntax-highlighting)?__

Yes, you can - if you are using a terminal with 256 colors!

To enable this feature you just need to install the ruby wrapper for
[pygments](http://pygments.org/):

``` sh
gem install pygments.rb
```

Additionally you can specify the used colorset through your `gitconfig` file(s).

``` sh
git config --global ghi.highlight.style colorful
```

Fire up an `irb/pry` session with the following to see a list of available
colorsets:

``` ruby
require 'pygments'
Pygments.styles
```

- __Can I use a custom $EDITOR for ghi?__

You can define a custom editor by specifying `ghi.editor` in your git
config (or export `$GHI_EDITOR` in your environment).

``` sh
git config --global ghi.editor vim
```

- __How do I create a milestone?__

Invoke `ghi milestone` with the `-s` option:

``` sh
$ git milestone -s open
```

This will open your editor to create the milestone. Much like creating an issue, the first line will be the title of the milestone, subsequent non-comment lines will be the milestone description.
